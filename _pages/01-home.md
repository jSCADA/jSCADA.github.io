### Open source SCADA system written in Java

jSCADA is developed at the [Institute of Systems Engineering](http://www.hevs.ch/isi) of the HES-SO Valais.

jSCADA was initially developed for educational reasons in order to show the basic concepts of SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) to the
students of the study branch "Infotronics" at the School of Engineering Valais in Sion.

jSCADA served multiple times as a starting point for research projects as well as for projects with industrial partners providing a base framework to
monitor or interconnect different sensor and actuator field technologies together. Another use case was to connect mature protocols like for example 
Modbus with modern IT protocols and technologies such as MQTT or Kura.

Over the time the importance of jSCADA for our institute has constantly increased and we decided early 2016 to release an open source version of the core
framework and a maximum of connection plugins to the community.

The open source code is still in early development, as we took the opportunity to refactor the framework and add unit tests before actually 
releasing each component of jSCADA.
